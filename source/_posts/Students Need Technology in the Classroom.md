Technology is everywhere--entwined in almost every portion of our lifestyle. It affects how we live, work, play, and most importantly master. With mobile and other wireless units like the IoT turning into a growing requirement across every market today, it only is practical our schools are as well effectively deploying cellular technology in the classroom. However, for most schools, implementing the most recent technology is a difficult strategy to navigate.

<b>There are two significant reasons for this:</b><br>
1. Schools are actually on the fence about the utilization of certain mobile devices; thinking they're more a burden when compared to a strategic learning tool.<br>
2. Schools want to deploy cellular devices but their WiFi networks aren't with the capacity of properly supporting the technology.
{% endcolorquote %}

In both cases it's a lose lose situation for everybody involved, specifically the students.

To help your university confidently decide to embrace mobile technology in the classroom, we've come up with a set of 10 reasons why it'll benefit your students.

Therefore, we've outlined how your school can make sure it's prepared to actually support those latest/added devices.

## Ten Explanations Why Your Students Have Technology in The Classroom

1. If used correctly, cellular devices and the applications they support, will help prepare students because of their future careers.
2. Integrating technology into the classroom is an efficient way to hook up with students of most learning styles.
3. It offers students the possibility to enhance the conversation with their classmates and instructors by encouraging collaboration.
4. Using technology found in the classroom offers teachers and other faculty customers the chance to develop their student's digital citizenship skills. It's one thing to use cellular devices, it's a completely other thing to learn how to utilize them correctly and responsibly.
5. Integrating technology in education helps pupils stay involved. Most students today have already been using cellular devices like tablets and smartphones to play and learn since they could crawl. So that it only seems logical to align today's classrooms with just how that your learners want and are being used to learning.
6. Combining new tech want VR (virtual certainty) with traditional classroom instruction is one example of how the introduction of new technology can enhance the learning encounter and create new chances.
7. When mobile phone technology is easily available and performing properly in the classroom, students are able to gain access to the most up-to-date information quicker and easier than ever before.
8. The original passive learning version is broken. With technology in the classroom the teacher turns into the encourager, adviser, and coach.
9. Technology helps learners be more dependable. Owning your own product or borrowing the school's devices gives pupils the opportunity to enhance their decision making expertise as well as bringing ownership of a very important (and frequently times expensive) device. Again, this needs to be complemented by right digital citizenship training to start to see the best results.
10. Technology transforms the training experience. Students get access to an unbelievable amount of new prospects. From learning how exactly to code to learning how exactly to better collaborate across clubs and with their instructors--technology empowers college students to become more creative and be considerably more linked. New tech has super-charged how exactly we learn today.

If your school continues to be debating how technology can benefit your students, teachers and administrators, I hate to break it to you, however the future of education has already been here and you're missing a fantastic amount of opportunities. 

## How Exactly to Support Technology Found in The Classroom

One of the primary mistakes schools produce when deploying or perhaps allowing new devices onto their campus and into their classrooms, is by not making sure their network infrastructure is up-to-date and/or perhaps sufficient enough to properly support their end-users.

We've seen numerous circumstances where schools have obtained and deployed fresh tablets or new notebook computers, and then find that nothing proved helpful because their Wi-Fi network couldn't support the brand new devices.

With tight budgets you can't afford to buy new devices and also have them not function; you have to get it ideal the first time.

Having a secure WiFi network is what makes using new mobile devices possible. Yes, cellular is a specialized skill and yes they're expensive, but they're also even more attainable than you might think.

After engineering and deploying a lot more than 1000+ wireless systems over the last 11 years, we've learned a whole lot in what should work and what essentially does work.

<b>A good few of the primary takeaways are:</b><br>
 - Your WiFi system must always align with the devices that are connecting to it<br>
 - Technical resources are costly and difficult to find<br>
 - User expectations are greater than ever<br>
 - Everything is continually changing (units, applications, how exactly we use WiFi, device figures, quantity users, even the physical environment)
{% endcolorquote %}
 
What makes this specifically challenging for academic institutions is that WiFi networks today just have a good shelf-life of between 3 to 4 years at the most effective. 

Realizing that traditionally, wireless systems are expensive of money to create, deploy and manage, just how do universities with almost no available finances get what they want?

Using WiFi as something, your school may have the actual wireless system it requires to support any technology approach it really wants to implement. Whether it's new tablets within a 1:1 course or BYOD, Wi-Fi as something enables academic institutions of any size to efficiently embrace technology and the mobile devices their students want and need.

<b>WiFi as something offers a range of benefits, for example:</b><br>
 - Affordable monthly payments<br>
 - Scalability to grow with your requirements up or down<br>
 - Guarantees you will have the latest system in place<br>
 - Allows you to prioritize your spending plan towards other mission-critical projects
